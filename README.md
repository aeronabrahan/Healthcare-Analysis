## Problem Statement
Understanding patient trends and healthcare system efficiency is critical for reducing costs, improving outcomes, and ensuring equitable care delivery. However, large volumes of hospital data are often difficult to interpret without proper tools.

---

## Objective
This dashboard was built to:
1. Analyze patient demographics and medical conditions
2. Assess billing trends and average length of hospital stay
3. Compare hospital and insurer performance
4. Discover admission and treatment patterns across the U.S.
5. Provide data-driven insights to healthcare stakeholders

---

## Key Questions

This healthcare dashboard was designed to answer the following questions:

1. What are the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients? Are certain groups being admitted more often than others?

2. Which medical conditions are diagnosed the most, and do they affect certain groups of people more than others?

3. How long do patients typically stay in the hospital for different conditions? Does this vary depending on the hospital or type of admission (emergency, urgent, or planned)?

4. How much does treatment usually cost for each condition? Are there big differences in costs between hospitals or insurance providers?

5. Which hospitals are treating the most patients, and how do they compare in terms of patient outcomes, like test results?

6. What medications are most often prescribed for each condition? Are they being used consistently across hospitals?

7. How are patients admitted ‚Äì mostly through emergency, urgent, or planned admissions ‚Äì and how does that impact the length of stay or treatment costs?

8. Which insurance companies are covering the most patients, and how does that relate to treatment costs and patient outcomes?

9. Where are the hospitals located, and are there any regional differences in health conditions, treatment quality, or billing amounts?

## Dashboard Design

The dashboard is structured into three key report pages, each aligned to the 9 critical healthcare questions.

---

### Overview  
Purpose: Provide a high-level snapshot of the patient population, admissions, and hospital volumes.

- KPI Cards:
  - Total Patients
  - Total Billing Amount
  - Avg Billing Amount
  - Avg Length of Stay
  - Emergency Admissions (%)
  - Top Medical Conditions  
  Explanation: These cards summarize overall healthcare system load, cost, and severity. They answer questions 1, 3, 4, and 7 by highlighting patient volume, cost burden, and admission breakdowns.

- Patient Demographics by Age Group (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 1. This visual helps identify which age groups are more frequently admitted and informs age-based health initiatives.

- Blood Type Distribution (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 1. Provides insights into blood type prevalence among patients which can be relevant for clinical and emergency preparedness.

- Hospital Patient Volume Comparison (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 5. Shows which hospitals have the highest patient load, allowing comparisons of capacity and demand.

- Most Common Medical Conditions (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 2. Highlights the dominant chronic illnesses which can guide preventive care programs and hospital planning.

- Gender Distribution of Patients (Donut Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 1. Identifies gender-related healthcare trends and helps with gender-specific medical policy decisions.

- Admission Type Breakdown (Donut Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 7. Shows whether patients are admitted via elective, urgent, or emergency channels‚Äîhelping to measure system strain.

---

### Conditions & Treatment Analysis  
Purpose: Deep-dive into how long patients stay, what conditions they have, what meds they‚Äôre given, and how admissions vary by gender or urgency.

- Hospital Stay Duration by Condition (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 3. Helps assess how different conditions affect resource use through extended hospitalization.

- Conditions by Gender Breakdown (Stacked Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 2. Allows exploration of which conditions are more prevalent in specific gender groups.

- Impact of Admission Type on Cost and Stay (Dual Axis Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 7. This shows how emergency admissions drive higher costs and longer stays, providing insight into hospital load and billing patterns.

- Average Billing per Condition (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 4. Compares cost of treating different medical conditions and helps insurers or administrators optimize treatment budgets.

- Top Prescribed Medications per Condition (Treemap)  
  Explanation: Answers question 6. Shows medication usage trends and helps evaluate whether treatments are consistent across hospitals.

---

### Insurance and Regional Healthcare Trends  
Purpose: Understand insurer roles, regional differences, and hospital-specific performance metrics.

- Patient Distribution by Insurance Provider (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 8. Shows the market share of major insurance providers and their patient base.

- Average Billing per Insurance Provider (Small Multiples)  
  Explanation: Answers question 4 and 8. Breaks down treatment cost variability across hospitals and insurance providers for accountability and transparency.

- Patient Outcomes by Insurance Provider (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 8. Displays percentage of abnormal test results, a proxy for treatment effectiveness and insurer-linked outcomes.

- Hospital Patient Load Overview (Bar Chart)  
  Explanation: Answers question 5. Shows which hospitals treat more patients, helping decision-makers allocate resources effectively.

- Geographic Distribution of Hospitals (Map)  
  Explanation: Answers question 9. Provides regional context, highlighting potential gaps or concentrations in healthcare accessibility.

- Hospital Workload by Diagnosed Conditions (Heatmap)  
  Explanation: Answers question 9. Helps identify patterns between hospitals and conditions, such as regional disease prevalence or specialization.
